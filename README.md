## DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION JUST YET! 
BottomBar is currently development only! The code is messy and **features and usage will change.**

BottomBar mimicks the new [Material Design Bottom navigation pattern](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/bottom-navigation.html). It is currently in active development, and by no means ready just yet.

**Currently working:**
* The fixed, three item bottom navigation bar in mobile devices
* Animations when the items change

**Currently not working:**
* Everything else.
